                        My name is Prasanna Deshappriya Bandara. I’m an undergraduate student from University of Moratuwa
                        and currently specializing ICE (Integrated Computer Engineering) stream where we focus on not only
                        the computer programming, but also hardware as well. I’m always curious about new technologies in
                        the world. Since I’m a passionate programmer and a fast learner, I can try and learn them within
                        short period of time.

                        <br><br>This website is my personal website and it is maintain by me. Here you can get to know about
                        my projects, my personal details, my skills and various other stuff. And most importantly, you are
                        most welcome to leave a comment as well. Some of my projects are listed under project section.
                        Under tutorial section, you can learn some basic programming stuffs about android studio, web development,
                        image processing and etc. Also there you can learn to
                        build libraries such as PCL(Point Cloud Library), OpenCV library and ect.

                        <br><br>Furthermore, I have completed several projects for the past few years. Some of them are
                        related to the academic modules (semester projects, etc. ) and some of them are not related
                        to the university modules. I have published them in this website so that you can get ideas to
                        your projects as well. Some of them are related to Image Processing and Point Cloud Processing,
                        in which case you need to find out how to build those libraries before following those projects.
                        My latest project is a mobile app called “Moodle”. This app is created with android studio and it
                        allows to interact with the university moodle account easily. You can easily get to know about
                        submissions and other academic related stuff without access to the moodle website. Furthermore,
                        users can track their SGPA and GPA as well. Apart from that I have completed a robot tailor project.
                        There users can connect multiple Kinects to same computer and use them simultaneously. They can take
                        multiple frames and register them. Then show a 3d point cloud to examin.

                        <br><br>Under the contact section you can contact me by ending an email. And my Facebook, Github, Twitter,
                        Linkedin profiles are listed below so that you can contact me there as well. Also you can see some
                        source codes of my projects in my github profile. Some of them may not public. If you need help
                        with a code, please send me a email.
